Command-line is kinda like the bit of a computer where you can speak right to its brain and make it do stuff.

1 - git push origin master - it's really just popping what you've done into storage
2 - git commit -m GIT_URL_HERE - changes whatever you're doing from a draft to something more permanent and tags it with a message of your choice
3 - cd - changes folders (directories)
4 - ls - lists what's in the current folder (directory)
5 - git clone GIT_URL_HERE - makes a copy of what you've done
6 - touch - makes a file
7 - cp - used to copy files
8 - mv - used to move files
9 - mkdir - makes a folder (directory) 
10 - pwd - shows where you are in folders (directories)
